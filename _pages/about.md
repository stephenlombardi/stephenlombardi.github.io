# About me

I'm a Research Scientist working at Facebook Reality Labs, Pittsburgh. I'm working on creating techniques to [render and animate photorealistic virtual humans in real time](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-oculus-codec-avatars-vr/). To do this, I'm combining ideas from computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning. I got my Ph.D. in 2016 from Drexel University, advised by [Ko Nishino](https://vision.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/), and I got my Bachelor's degree in 2009 from The College of New Jersey.
